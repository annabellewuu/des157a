        <h1>Final Project Expert Review & Report</h1>


        <h2>Visual Design Critiques & Report:</h2>
        <p>Skylar Laroche, the Undergraduate Student Tutor for DES 157A, expressed a positive response to the overall design visualizations I have developed thus far. He primarily critiqued the visual design aspect of my project and suggested dividing the page that requests user input into two pages to reduce cognitive overload. Additionally, he recommended using a different font for the smaller text, as the current boldness appears too similar to my titles. Skylar pointed out that I could take the moon from the original Mad Libs submission and incorporate it back into this design version too. In general, he likes my new design visualizations and thinks my bunny character designs are cute. </p>
        <p>The second person I sought feedback from is Ginnie Lo, currently a Visual Designer at Cisco. After reviewing my design visualizations, she remarked that the overall UX/UI flow of the project makes sense. Ginnie pointed out that I am missing a "Next" button on my input page and suggested spacing out the inputs due to the abundance of words and information on that page. She also recommended using outlines instead of fills for the input boxes, as they currently like my buttons. In conclusion, Ginnie expressed her liking for the redesign of my Mad Libs, stating that the new version looks cleaner than before.</p>
