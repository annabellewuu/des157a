        <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
        <p>I am going to update my Mad Libs Project and I plan to focus on elevating its visual design and enhancing the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).</p>
        
        <h2>Project Description:</h2>
        <p>To enhance the visual design of my MadLibs Project, I am considering the integration of dynamic elements to effectively present the unfolding narrative of my Mad Libs story. One idea I have in mind is incorporating various bunny visuals, such as the gradual opening of the rabbit eyes to reveal the story in my Mad Libs. Another concept involves working on the hierarchy of my Mad Libs, spacing out each section of the form, allowing users to experience and engage with their Mad Libs story along the way.</p>
        <p>For UX/UI design, I aim to optimize the reading experience by prioritizing intuitiveness and visual appeal. I plan to refine my design system to enhance the overall aesthetic of my website and provide an enjoyable user experience. This entails refining the layout, improving readability, and implementing user-friendly navigation features to enhance the engagement and accessibility of the Mad Libs interaction.</p>

        <h2>Expert Feedback:</h2>
        <p>I have spoken with Sky Laroche, the Undergraduate Student Tutor, regarding the enhancement of my designs and strategies to progress further with this project. He has provided me with ideas that I can incorporate to improve my visual design and UX/UI. Another individual I am interested in consulting regarding the improvement of my visual design and UX/UI is Ginnie, a Visual Designer at Cisco. I believe that getting feedback with these two designers will allow me to gain a better understanding of areas for improvement in my Mad Libs project.</p>
